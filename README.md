# 📊 Portfolio Stress Testing & Optimization using Python & Tableau

This project was completed as part of the Infotact Data Analytics Internship (Month-2 Project).

The objective of the project is to analyze financial market data, measure portfolio risk, simulate future outcomes, optimize asset allocation, and build an interactive dashboard for stress testing using real-world stock data.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Calculate daily log returns for multiple stocks.
- Analyze historical and rolling volatility.
- Compute Value at Risk (VaR) at 95% confidence.
- Perform Monte Carlo simulation to forecast portfolio performance.
- Construct the Efficient Frontier for portfolio optimization.
- Identify optimal portfolios based on:
  - Maximum Sharpe Ratio
  - Minimum Volatility
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard with market shock scenarios.

## 📁 Dataset

The portfolio consists of historical daily stock prices for:

- TCS  
- Reliance  
- HDFC Bank  
- SBI  

Each dataset includes:
- Date
- Adjusted Closing Price
